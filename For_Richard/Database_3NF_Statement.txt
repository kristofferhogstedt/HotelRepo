All tables
------------
All tables contain the following data for necessary data record-keeping
* CreatedDate
* UpdatedDate
* IsInactive
* InactivatedDate



Bookings
------------
FK - RoomID
FK - CustomerID
Only handles FromDate and ToDate, the rest of the data is stored in either Rooms, Customers or Invoices tables




Customers
------------
Does not meet 3NF. Address data should be handled in a separate table. (StreetAddress, PostalCode, City, Country)

Apart from that I believe the other data points are valid under 3NF for customer info



Invoices
------------
FK - BookingID
Has a Foreign Key to Bookings via BookingID, otherwise only contain data for Amount, DueDate and IsPaid. PaidDate

------------
Apart from Name column (which states wether its a Single, Double, Family or Suite type room), this table contains default values and max values of various RoomDetails data.



Rooms
------------
Contains data about Rooms and data about the location of a room, basically data about the location of the door; Name, Description and Floor. Details about the (inside of the-) room is stored in the RoomDetails table.



RoomDetails 
------------
FK - RoomID
FK - RoomTypeID
Contains detailed info about each Room; Price, Size and NumberOfBeds.
